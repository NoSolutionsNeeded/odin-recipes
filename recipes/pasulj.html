<h3>Pasulj (Serbian White Bean Soup) Recipe</h3>
<p>Serbian white bean soup, or pasulj, is a hearty stick-to-the-ribs affair that can be made with or without meat though this version is with meat. </p> <br>

<p>True, Serbian bean soup is made with the white tetovac (тетовац) bean, but Great Northern beans work just as well! The soup can be thickened with a zafrig (roux) if desired, or partially puréed. Personally, I prefer mine chunky.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound Tetovac white beans, or Great Northern beans, rinsed</li>
        <li>4 quarts cold water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ham hock, or ham bone, or smoked sausage for slow cooker version</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>3 carrots, peeled and sliced or medium chopped</li>
        <li>3 medium red potatoes, peeled and cut into medium pieces</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, medium chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, medium chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to make it</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large soup pot, place beans, water, and ham. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally so beans don't stick, and skimming off any foam that rises to the surface. Add salt and pepper to taste. Lower temperature and simmer 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Add vegetables, bring back to the boil, reduce heat, and continue to simmer for 1 more hour. Remove the meat from the ham hock or ham bone and return to soup.

        </li>
        <li>If the soup isn't thick enough, you can add an optional zafrig or thickener. In a small saucepan, add oil and flour and cook until light brown. Add paprika off heat, stirring well. Return to low heat and add 1 cup bean soup, mixing well. Pour back into the soup pot and simmer 5 minutes or until soup is thickened to your liking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve in heated bowls garnished with chopped parsley if desired. It tastes even better the next day.
        </li>
      </ol>
